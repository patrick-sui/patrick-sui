I am  a second-year PhD student in English at McGill University, advised by [Richard Jean So](https://richardjeanso.wixsite.com/mysite/light-art). I mainly work in digital humanities & cultural analytics with NLP methods, and spend most of my time thinking about how literary studies could uniquely contribute to AI research about language. I publish in a mix of NLP venues and humanities journals.

Some research questions I am currently interested in include:
1. Exploring LLMs as viable cultural agents and co-creative systems, through making use of the affordances of hallucinations as [confabulations](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.770/)
1. Making use of the vast, high-quality, yet unexplored data produced by humanities departments to advance NLP research goals. I'm currently collecting a dataset of student essays to create the first literary & interpretive reasoning benchmark
1. Modeling close reading (a skill that most universities ask English departments to teach all undergrads) as a unique cognitive behavior, and formalizing its procedures with information theory to supervise sampling and other inference-time solutions for improving long document understanding
1. Leveraging archives of literary scholarship as a weighted knowledge base for author-based style transfer.

I am open to collaborate. Please feel free to reach out if you have similar research interests.
